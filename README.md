## Overview
I've been doing this as some sort of coding project to learn AresMUSH. Now I'm putting it out there for anyone willing to use it. The marque affects the adept phase of courtesan life. If you want some code-side support of this in your Kushiel-based game, go ahead, use it as is or adapt it to your needs.

### What this plugin covers
* Chargen: Setting marque during chargen.
* Profile: Making the marque part of the profile.
* Staff-side marque management commands from within the game.
* Staff-side marque management route from the webportal.
* Awarding achievements when completing phases of novice and adept.

### Prerequesites
The marque plugin relies on the fact that 'Courtesan' is set up as a faction (group), and that ranks 'Novice', 'Adept', 'Courtesan', etc have been defined to that faction. When moving on from novice to adept rank, the marque will be started. When the marque is complete and has been acknowledged, the rank will change to (fully marqued) 'Courtesan'.
